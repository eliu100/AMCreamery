        <p>Our privacy policy is so simple that even you can figure it out.  
          We will sell every bit of information on you we have in order 
          to make that nice cash money. If you have sensitive information that you don't want us to 
          share with the world, then keep it to yourself -- don't tell us.  
          <br><br>
          It's really that simple.
